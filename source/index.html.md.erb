#### The Heart of Design

This is my design system. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My design system is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my design system is useless. Without my design system, I am useless.

This is not a framework or a design system, but a starting point. This is a **collection of concepts**, SCSS, and Javascript bundled together to make prototyping faster and more efficient. Its purpose is to speed up _prototype building_, and such, will sometimes make sacrifices in load speed and efficiency.

Iâ€™ve used this system for several projects, and it has saved a lot of time on every project.

## Overview

If you reuse design processes and UI patterns over and over, why reinvent the wheel? Save yourself time and create a toolbox of reusable components. Every designer should have their own collection. You may use this for your projects, or use this as a starting point for your own.

The idea is to centralize thought, processes and learning from previous projects for the betterment of future projects. Standardizations, conventions, and checklists will reduce the amount of work, deduplicate thought, and reduce for future projects. [Surgeons use checklists to save lives](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122226184), so let's learn from them.

### Style Guide 
<div class="_font-small _font-bold"> (Cheat Sheet) </div>

The style guide is set up to provide assistance to prototypes and new projects with implementations to common UI patterns with SCSS and JS. Projects can import all of the style guide `_stylecoeur`, or selectively import certain components, then differentiate on top of the core.
