# Sidebar

`_sidebar.scss`

The sidebar is used for styling the sidebar (like the one used for this style guide). It's slightly similar in functionality to the sidenav.

A little javascript with MagicScroll is required to keep the menu to stick the left side, if needed: just add a span with the class `_sticky-tr` to make it work.

Note: The pinned state uses the somewhat-supported `position: sticky` element.
